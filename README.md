# -Impacts-of-Managed-Charging-and-Other-Innovative-Rates-
This repository contains data workflows, analysis scripts, and documentation developed for EV-specific Time-of-Use (TOU) rate design (2023–2024).
Work includes hurdle-model regression for EV charging likelihood and magnitude, tariff performance comparisons across load and weather conditions, and supporting analysis for rate structure development. Materials summarize empirical insights used to inform residential EV charging behavior forecasts, tariff design considerations, and carbon-alignment implications.
